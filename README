 Description:
 The purpose of this programming assignment is for you to practice:
 ARM assembly, especially branching and looping logic
 Calling assembly routines in a C program and vice versa
 Passing parameters and returning values to and from assembly routines
 Parsing and using command line arguments

 How to build/compile the program:
 1) You first login to the ucsd ieng6 account
 2) Then we need to ssh cs30xxy@pi-cluster.ucsd.edu
 3) Then we need to creat a directory named pa1
 4) Then we write c and assembly and c files
 5) Then we build the assembly and c files by following the pa instructions
 6) Afterward, we compile the program by "make"
 7) Usually, we might need to "make clean" 
 8) Then we would have a executionable file named pa1
 9) we run the program by saying ./pa1

 Example of normal output:

 cs30fex@pi-cluster-027:~/pa1$ ./pa1 13 a . c

 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 ac......cccccca
 acc.....ccccc.a
 accc....cccc..a
 acccc...ccc...a
 accccc..cc....a
 acccccc.c.....a
 a......c......a
 a.....c.cccccca
 a....cc..ccccca
 a...ccc...cccca
 a..cccc....ccca
 a.ccccc.....cca
 acccccc......ca
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa


 Example of abnormal output:

 cs30fex@pi-cluster-027:~/pa1$ ./pa1 1231231 a . c

     height(1231231) must be within the range of [3 - 145]

 
 How you tested your program:
 I used gdb to help me debug the errors. By step, next, nexti commands, I am
 able to find the compilation and logical erros at specific lines of function. 
 In this pa, there are a lot of segmentation errors. I used gdp to find the
 memory leaks and was able to make sure the program run without bugs. Then
 finally, I used the diff command to find the difference between the original
 and the standard solution.

 README QUESTIONS:
 1) What Vim command can you use to divide the screen vertically? Horizontally?

 :vsplit FILENAME (stackoverflow)

 2) What Vim command do you use to select a character? What command would you
 use to select an entire line?

 To select a character, we use command v in command mode. 
 To select entire line, we use command V in command mode. 
 (stackoverflow)

 3) You realized you made a spelling error when using one of the constants from
 the pa1.h file. Instead of ASCII_MIN, you? You've been typing ASCI_MIN (without
 the extra I). How would you find and replace all occurrences of ASCI_MIN in
 your file to be ASCII_MIN?

 :%s/ASCI_MIN/ASCII_MIN/g

 4) Before you merge your current version, what Git command(s) would you use to
 check if there are no conflicts between your current version and the version
 last commited?

 git diff

 5) What Git command would you use to undo a bad commit that has been already
 pushed?

 git revert

 6) What Git command would you use to see the history of all your commits?

 git log

 7) You finished the PA since you started early, but your friend hasn't and
 just started working on it even though it's due tonight at 11:59 pm. Your
 friend knows you are done with the PA and has asked you to help them so they
 can finish in time. What do you do to act with integrity?

 We should say no. At best, we can/should teach them the concepts based on the 
 book or professor's notes. But never share our code.
